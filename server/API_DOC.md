## 📖 Module-wise Functionality Breakdown

### 1. 🔐 Authentication & Security Module
*   **Purpose**: Manages user lifecycle, security, and session integrity.
*   **Key Workflows**:
    *   **Secure Registration**: Uses password hashing and email-based OTP verification to prevent bot accounts.
    *   **JWT Session Management**: Issues signed tokens upon login/verification for stateless authorization.
    *   **Account Recovery**: Implements a standard forgot/reset password flow using time-sensitive signed links.
    *   **Profile Control**: Allows users to manage their identity (username) and register push notification tokens (FCM).

### 2. 🆔 KYC (Know Your Customer) Module
*   **Purpose**: Establishes trust and compliance within the marketplace.
*   **Key Workflows**:
    *   **Identity Submission**: Users upload government ID and business documents via a multi-part form.
    *   **Verification Guard**: Most marketplace actions (listing, bidding) are gated by `kycVerifiedOnly` middleware, ensuring only vetted users can trade.
    *   **Admin Audit**: Admins manually review submissions to approve or reject based on document validity.

### 3. 💎 Inventory Module
*   **Purpose**: The central repository for all diamond assets listed on the platform.
*   **Key Workflows**:
    *   **Rich Asset Upload**: Supports multiple images and video attachments per diamond entry.
    *   **Data Accuracy**: Validates diamond attributes (carat, color, clarity, etc.) against strict schemas.
    *   **Ownership Integrity**: Ensures only the original seller or an admin can modify/delete an inventory item.

### 4. 🔨 Auction & Bidding Module
*   **Purpose**: Facilitates dynamic price discovery and competitive buying.
*   **Key Workflows**:
    *   **Auction Creation**: Sellers convert their static inventory items into live auctions with reserve prices and durations.
    *   **Bidding Engine**: Buyers place bids which are tracked in real-time. Only KYC-verified buyers can participate.
    *   **Bid Management**: Sellers can accept a bid to lock in a price, which automatically halts the auction and initiates the Deal phase.

### 5. 🤝 Deal & Transaction Module
*   **Purpose**: Manages the post-auction workflow from agreement to final settlement.
*   **Key Workflows**:
    *   **Deal Initialization**: Triggered when a bid is accepted; it creates a formal contract between buyer and seller.
    *   **State Machine Management**: Tracks deal progress through various stages: `Pending`, `Paid`, `Shipped`, `Completed`, or `Disputed`.
    *   **PDF Documentation**: Automatically generates professional invoices/receipts for both parties.

### 6. 💳 Payment & Escrow Module (Stripe Integration)
*   **Purpose**: Provides secure, trustless financial transactions.
*   **Key Workflows**:
    *   **Buyer Escrow**: Funds are captured from the buyer via Stripe Payment Intents and held securely ('Escrow').
    *   **Seller Onboarding**: Uses Stripe Connect to verify seller bank accounts for payouts.
    *   **Conditional Release**: Funds are only released to the seller after the buyer confirms receipt, protecting both parties from fraud.

### 7. 💬 Communication & Notification Module
*   **Purpose**: Keeps users engaged and informed in real-time.
*   **Key Workflows**:
    *   **Real-time Chat**: Private messaging channels between buyers and sellers to discuss specifics.
    *   **Multimodal Notifications**: Combines in-app alerts with Firebase (FCM) push notifications for critical events (new bids, deal updates).
    *   **Read Tracking**: Ensures users stay updated by tracking message and notification read states.

### 8. 🛡️ Admin & Analytics Module
*   **Purpose**: Global oversight, platform maintenance, and business intelligence.
*   **Key Workflows**:
    *   **System Auditing**: Provides granular logs of every administrative and system-level event for security audits.
    *   **Business Intelligence**: Dahsboard stats and revenue analytics provide insights into platform growth and financial performance.
    *   **User Governance**: Admins can activate/deactivate accounts and resolve high-level disputes.
